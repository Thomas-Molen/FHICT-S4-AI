    "### Introduction\n",
    "As someone who enjoys watching movies, there often seems to be a polarizing difference between what movies perform well and which ones do not. With movies being [a billion-dollar industry](https://www.boxofficepro.com/mpa-2019-global-box-office-and-home-entertainment-surpasses-100-billion/), there seems to be a lot of risk and reward involved when investing and making movies. \n",
    "  \n",
    "I am interested in finding possible patterns to predict how much a movie will earn in the box office compared to the amount of money spent on budget. This could give movie companies a clearer vision of how much they should spend for the best result, reducing the amount of risk taken when investing in movies with budgets of [100 million+ dollars](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all)."

    "The most obvious ones are the production and distribution companies such as:  \n",
    "[Paramount Pictures Studios](http://www.paramountstudios.com/), [Warner Bros. Pictures](https://www.warnerbros.com/company/divisions/motion-pictures), [Sony Pictures](https://www.sonypictures.com/), [Lionsgate](https://www.lionsgate.com/), etc.  \n",

Other than this information such as the cast, genre, runtime, release date and critic scores are also widely available.  \n",
